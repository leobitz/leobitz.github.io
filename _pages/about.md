Hi there,

I'm currently working on building an autonomous and adaptive system to defend attacks against AI systems such as Chatbots, Agents, Multi-modal services and so on. Its a combination of both research and engineering, and we will soon release our product. If you want to learn more, please reach out.

I'm broadly interested in understanding and building intelligent systems. This include theoretical research on deep learning and applying them on novel tasks. Furthermore, making models more efficient while keeping performance very high is my a personal challenge. I also enjoy developing products, and my current work at [TestSavant.AI](TestSavant.AI) is training LLMs and RL agents to defend attacks and learn autonomously as time goes by.
